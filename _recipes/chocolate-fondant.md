A classic melt-in-the-middle dessert. The trick is: cold moulds, properly mixed batter, and confident timing.

## Ingredients

- 50g butter, melted (for brushing the moulds)
- Cocoa powder (for dusting)
- 200g dark chocolate, chopped
- 200g butter, cubed
- 200g golden caster sugar
- 4 eggs + 4 egg yolks
- 200g plain flour
- To serve (optional): caramel sauce + vanilla ice cream or orange sorbet

## Method

1. Brush the moulds with melted butter, chill briefly, then brush again and dust with cocoa.
2. Melt the chocolate and 200g butter together gently, then let it cool for about 10 minutes.
3. Whisk eggs, yolks, and sugar until pale, thick, and ribbon-like.
4. Fold in the flour, then pour in the chocolate mixture and mix until smooth.
5. Divide into moulds and chill at least 20 minutes (or overnight).
6. Bake at 200°C (180°C fan) until the tops are set and the edges begin to pull away (about 10–12 minutes).
7. Rest 1 minute, loosen, turn out, and serve immediately.

## Notes

- Bake one tester first to calibrate timing for your oven.

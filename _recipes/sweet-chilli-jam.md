A glossy, sweet-and-warm chilli jam. Great with cheese, sandwiches, or anything that needs a kick.

## Ingredients

- 8 red peppers, deseeded, roughly chopped
- 10 red chillies, roughly chopped (seeds included for heat)
- 1 finger-sized piece fresh ginger, peeled, chopped
- 8 garlic cloves, peeled
- 400g can cherry tomatoes
- 750g golden caster sugar
- 250ml red wine vinegar

## Method

1. Blitz peppers, chillies, ginger, and garlic until very finely chopped.
2. Tip into a heavy pan with tomatoes, sugar, and vinegar. Bring to a boil, skimming any foam.
3. Simmer gently for about 50 minutes, stirring occasionally.
4. Cook 10–15 minutes more until sticky and thick, stirring often to prevent catching.
5. Spoon into sterilised jars and cool fully. Refrigerate after opening.

## Notes

- Stir more frequently near the end — that’s when it can scorch.
